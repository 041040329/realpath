This is a implementation of realpath() function in Go (golang).

If you provide it with a valid relative path / alias path, it will return you
with a string of its real absolute path in the system.

The original version is created by Taru Karttunen in golang-nuts group:

Sample usage:

  import "realpath"

  func main() {
    myRealpath, err := realpath.Realpath("/some/path")
  }
